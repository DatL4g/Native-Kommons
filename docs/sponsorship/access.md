# Access management

The Native-Kommons repository is a private repository hosted on GitHub and access is, therefore, managed through GitHub.
This section covers everything you need to know in order to gain access to the private repository.

## How to get access

As the private Native-Kommons repository is hosted on GitHub, you require a GitHub account to become a sponsor and gain access.
After sponsoring me on one of our sponsoring tiers starting at $1 a month, you'll get access to the private repository.

### Individuals

If you sponsor using a personal account, you will receive an invitation link via email to the private Native-Kommons repository immediately after initiating your sponsorship.
This link is valid for seven days.
Once you accept the invitation, you'll be ready to get started.

### Organizations

When sponsoring using an organization account, GitHub will not send an automated invitation via email to access the private Native-Kommons repository.
Due to GitHub limitations, granting access to a private repository for an entire organization is not possible.

Therefore, please contact me at sponsors@datlag.dev with the name of a personal account or the name of a bot account that is publicly or privately listed as an owner of your GitHub organization after you received a confirmation that your sponsorship was initiated.

I will add this designated account as a collaborator, and once the invitation is accepted within seven days, your organization will be all set to get started.

### Enterprises

If you would like to sponsor me using an enterprise account, I recommend using a personal account or a bot account to initiate the sponsorship and access the private Native-Kommons repository using this account.
